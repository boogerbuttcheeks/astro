In September 2022 I was selected to lead a team of seven developers and designers to create Phished, a platform where users are empowered to protect their friends & family from phishing attacks.

Phished is still under development and will be officially unveiled at BCIT's Telus Theatre on December 2 – until then, feel free to check out the site as it develops at [phished.app](https://phished.app).
